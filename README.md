# QueueMe
QueuMe is a web application, found at [queueme.rocks](http://www.queueme.rocks), that allows users to create queues for resources, line up to use them, and see who else is using which resources or who's in line to use them.

QueueMe is written in the Python-Flask back end framework, uses MongoDB as its database, and uses Bootstrap and Angular for the front end.
